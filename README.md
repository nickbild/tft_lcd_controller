# TFT LCD Controller

Controller for a TFT LCD display such as [this](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1480).

The goal is to drive it with my custom 6502-based [Vectron 64](https://github.com/nickbild/vectron_64) computer.

An early mockup with a microcontroller driving signals in a manner that can be replicated on the [Vectron 64](https://github.com/nickbild/vectron_64).
